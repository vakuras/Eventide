# Changelog

All notable changes to Eventide are documented here.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Sidebar search now matches across all title sources** ([#6](https://github.com/vakuras/Eventide/pull/6)) — search previously only scanned `events.jsonl`, so sessions renamed via Eventide's double-click rename (`.eventide-title`) or Copilot CLI's `/rename` slash command (`workspace.yaml` `name`) were unreachable unless the new name also appeared in the transcript. Title resolution now walks `.eventide-title` → `meta.name` → `meta.summary` → events fallback, and `meta.name` is treated as a user-chosen title (no truncation, no quoted-prompt cleanup). The new `_searchTitleForOccurrences` reads the same priority chain and emits a `sourceLabel: 'title'` hit; title matches are prepended to the results so they rank above transcript hits (within the existing 3-occurrence cap).

### Tests
- Added test coverage in `test/session-service.test.js` for the new title-source resolution and search ranking (final results: 270 pass / 11 pre-existing failures, unchanged).

## [0.7.3] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- **Mouse-wheel scrolling cycled prompt history in REPL TUIs** ([#5](https://github.com/vakuras/Eventide/pull/5)) — regression from v0.7.2. With mouse-tracking stripped and the terminal on the alt screen buffer (Copilot CLI's TUI), xterm.js's default wheel handler translated wheel-up/down into cursor-up/down (`\x1b[A` / `\x1b[B`), which Copilot CLI's prompt consumed as arrow keys and cycled input history. Added `src/terminal-wheel.js` which re-implements the wheel→SGR mouse-button bridge ourselves via `attachCustomWheelEventHandler`: synthesizes `\x1b[<64;X;YM` (wheel up) / `\x1b[<65;X;YM` (wheel down), derives 1-based cell coords from the wrapper's bounding rect, caps ticks at 10 per event to prevent trackpad fling floods, and returns `false` to suppress the cursor-key fallback. Drag and click are not synthesized, so native selection and the existing `Ctrl+C` copy handler keep working.

### Tests
- Added 17 unit tests in `test/terminal-wheel.test.js` covering SGR encoding (buttons 64/65, M terminator), `deltaMode` 0/1/2 conversion, tick capping, zero/missing/non-numeric inputs, multi-tick escape emission, wrapper-based cell-coord derivation, fallback to (1, 1) without a wrapper, and defensive paths (missing api, throwing `writePty`).

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- **Terminal drag-to-select / `Ctrl+C` copy broken** ([#4](https://github.com/vakuras/Eventide/pull/4)) — Copilot CLI enables xterm mouse-tracking modes (`?1000`, `?1002`, `?1006`, …) on startup, which made xterm.js forward mouse events to the PTY instead of creating a native text selection. `terminal.hasSelection()` was always `false`, so `Ctrl+C` sent SIGINT instead of copying. Added `src/pty-data-filter.js` which strips `ESC [ ? <params> h|l` mouse-mode IDs (`9`, `1000`, `1001`, `1002`, `1003`, `1005`, `1006`, `1015`, `1016`) from PTY output before handing it to `terminal.write()`. Combined sequences like `\x1b[?25;1002h` correctly retain the non-mouse params (`\x1b[?25h`). Right-click and drag-select now work as expected; the existing copy handler in `keyboard-shortcuts.js` starts firing automatically.

### Tests
- Added 13 unit tests in `test/pty-data-filter.test.js` covering each tracking mode, combined-mode sequences, partial removal preserving non-mouse params, unrelated CSI passthrough, mixed content, and null/undefined/non-string inputs (243/243 non-pre-existing tests passing).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Session start/resume broken on copilot CLI 1.0.57+** — the underlying `copilot --resume <id>` now only resumes *existing* sessions and rejects pre-generated UUIDs for new sessions. Switched both runtimes to `--session-id <id>`, which per `copilot --help` "Resume an existing session or task by ID, or set the UUID for a new session" — works for both new and resume.
- **`unexpected argument --resume` when using `agency.exe`** — the Electron build was spawning `agency --session-id ...` directly, but those flags belong to agency's `copilot` subcommand. Electron `pty-manager.js` now injects the `copilot` subcommand when the configured binary is `agency`/`agency.exe` (case-insensitive), matching the existing Tauri `pty_host.rs` behavior.

### Tests
- Added 7 new tests in `pty-manager.test.js` covering the flag name and agency subcommand injection (45/45 passing).

  - `npm start` / `npm run dist` → Electron build (full-featured, ~150MB)
  - `npm run tauri:dev` / `npm run tauri:build` → Tauri build (lightweight, ~12MB)
- **Electron frontend rebased on DeepSky v0.9.0** — brings all DeepSky features:
  - Pre-warmed standby sessions for instant startup
  - Custom notification popups (themed Catppuccin toasts)
  - Full notification service with file watcher
  - Session eviction with graceful shutdown
  - 20 unit tests
- **Tauri backend preserved** — all Rust services (PTY, sessions, settings, tags, resources, status, notifications) unchanged

### Added
- Electron build config (electron-builder, NSIS installer)
- `node-pty` + `electron-updater` dependencies for Electron mode
- Electron `main.js`, `preload.js`, and all Node.js backend services
- `tauri-bridge.js` provides the same `window.api` interface for Tauri builds

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **Auto-update toggle** — enable or disable automatic update checking from the Updates tab
- **Toggle switches** — modern iOS/macOS-style toggles replace old checkbox controls
- **Expandable tag overflow** — clicking the "+N" badge on a session card expands all hidden tags (was hover-only)
- **Settings rows** — label + control side-by-side layout with descriptions

### Changed
- **Diff panel is now inline** — slides open like the status panel with a width transition instead of overlaying as an absolute panel

- Terminal refits after diff panel open/close transition

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Diff view panel** — view file diffs from session changes with unified/split toggle, file list, and resizable panel

## [0.2.5] - 2026-03-28

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Settings close button stays visible** — header is now sticky, × button no longer scrolls away
- Close button hover turns red for clarity — no longer mistaken for directory clear button

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Fix terminal input freezing** — removed pending buffer in pty_host stdin handler that could stall when escape sequences split across reads
- Improved write error handling — marks session as dead on write failure instead of propagating error
- Simplified pty_host stdin→PTY forwarding for reliability

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-28

- Added `core:window:allow-show` capability for deferred window display

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
